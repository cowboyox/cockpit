Cockpit, a remote manager for GNU/Linux servers
===============================================

Cockpit runs in a browser and can manage your network of GNU/Linux
machines.

CAVEAT:

    This is pre-release software.  Only install it in a system that
    you are ready to lose.  It is a good idea to make a virtual
    machine (or three) to play around with Cockpit.

NOTE:

    We are just ramping up, and things are a bit rough around the
    edges. Even compiling and running this code is quite involved, as
    it depends on a few external packages that aren't released yet.

    Running ./configure should give you some hints as to what you are
    missing and where to get it from.
